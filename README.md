## Questions for Professors
* After 300 seconds should the temp graph show 301+ history or delete oldest temp history?
* Does the 3rd box need to be waterproof?

## TO DO
* Make gant chart
* Read requirements and split up tasks
* Schematic?

## Needed Supplies
* LCD - Emma
* 2 Buttons - Emma
* Breadboard and wires - Bella
* Tape - probably Bella
* Stuff to make a thermometer box (3D print?)

## **Week 1: First Prototype

ðŸ”¹ **Goals:** Parts chosen, basic prototype working.

* **Wednesday Goal:**

  * Read requirements carefully.
  * Break down unclear specs; assign someone to ask TA/professor.
  * Decide on hardware (sensors, microcontroller, display, connectors).
  * Set up Git repo/Google Drive/Notion for code + docs.

* **Hardware:**

  * Order/gather parts (sensors, display, connectors, enclosure).
  * Build rough breadboard prototype with sensors + power switch.

* **Embedded:**

  * Write simple code to read a single sensor and print temperature.

* **Web:**

  * Set up skeleton app (basic page with placeholder temperature, graph layout).

* **Integration/Testing:**

  * Start lab notebook and project documentation.
  * Define **test plan** (sensor unplug, drop test, button timing, etc.).
